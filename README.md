📊 Dataset Description

The dataset contains historical Walmart sales records, including:
Date – Weekly sales date
Weekly_Sales – Sales revenue
Store / Department information (if available)
Economic & holiday indicators (if present)
Sales data is aggregated at a weekly level to support accurate time-series forecasting.

.

🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The EDA process focuses on:
Understanding sales distribution and variability
Detecting trends over time
Identifying seasonal behavior
Spotting anomalies and sales spikes
Visualizing sales performance
Key techniques:
Line plots
Statistical summaries
Seasonal decomposition

🔮 Forecasting Approach
Model Used: SARIMA
SARIMA (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) is chosen due to:
Strong performance on seasonal retail data
Interpretability
Industry adoption for demand forecasting
Model Components:
AR (AutoRegressive)
I (Integrated differencing)
MA (Moving Average)
Seasonal components with weekly periodicity


📐 Model Evaluation

Forecast performance is evaluated using:
MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
These metrics provide a reliable measure of prediction accuracy and business impact.


📈 Results & Insights

Clear seasonal patterns in Walmart sales
Strong correlation between time and revenue growth
SARIMA effectively captures both trend and seasonality
Generated future sales forecasts for strategic planning
